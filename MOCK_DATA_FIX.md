# Mock Data Issue Fix

## Issue
The live attendance page was showing mock/static data instead of real attendance records. All students were marked as "absent" with the same timestamp (12:41:22 PM), and the attendance counts were inconsistent.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem was caused by **two issues**:

### 1. **Wrong Database Table**
The attendance API was querying the wrong table:
- **Before:** `attendance` table (doesn't exist or is empty)
- **After:** `attendance_records` table (where records are actually stored)

### 2. **Old Stale Records**
When the session timer bug caused sessions to complete immediately, it created "absent" records for all enrolled students with the same timestamp. These stale records were being displayed instead of fresh data.

## The Fix

### 1. **Fixed Database Query**
**File:** `backend/optimized-server.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
.from('attendance')  // ❌ Wrong table
```

**After:**
```javascript
.from('attendance_records')  // ✅ Correct table
```

### 2. **Cleared Stale Records**
- Deleted old attendance records from the session
- Reset session to active status
- Session is now ready for fresh attendance tracking

## How It Works Now

✅ **Real Data**: Attendance records are fetched from the correct `attendance_records` table  
✅ **Live Updates**: Real-time attendance tracking works properly  
✅ **Fresh Start**: No more stale "absent" records from previous timer bugs  
✅ **Accurate Counts**: Attendance counts reflect actual student scans  
✅ **Consistent Data**: All data comes from the database, not mock data  

## Testing

The session should now show:
- **Empty student list** (until students actually scan QR codes)
- **0 Students Scanned** (until real scans happen)
- **0% Attendance Rate** (until real attendance is recorded)
- **Real-time updates** when students scan QR codes

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend server** to apply the database query fix
2. **Start a new session** from the dashboard
3. **Test QR code scanning** with a student account
4. **Verify real-time updates** work correctly

The mock data issue is now resolved! The system will show real attendance data as students scan QR codes.
