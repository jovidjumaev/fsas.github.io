# Session Timer Fix

## Issue
Sessions were closing immediately after opening, showing "session expired and now is completed" message.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem was **NOT** with QR code expiration (which is correctly set to 30 seconds for security). The issue was with the **session timer calculation**:

1. **Missing Activation Time**: The session activation wasn't tracking when the session was started
2. **Frontend Timer Logic**: The frontend couldn't calculate the 1-hour session duration without knowing when the session was activated
3. **Immediate Completion**: Without a proper timer, the session appeared to be "expired" immediately

## The Fix

### 1. **Track Session Activation Time**
**File:** `backend/session-management-api.js`

**Added `updated_at` field to track activation:**
```javascript
.update({
  status: 'active',
  is_active: true,
  qr_secret: qrData.secret,
  qr_expires_at: qrData.expires_at,
  notes: notes || null,
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString() // Track activation time
})
```

### 2. **Use Activation Time for Timer Calculation**
**File:** `src/app/professor/sessions/active/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

**Changed from non-existent `activated_at` to `updated_at`:**
```javascript
activated_at: session.updated_at, // Use updated_at as activation time
```

### 3. **Restored Correct QR Code Security Settings**
- **QR Code Expiration**: 30 seconds (security feature)
- **QR Code Rotation**: Every 30 seconds (prevents cheating)
- **Session Duration**: 1 hour (independent of QR codes)

## How It Works Now

### Session Timeline:
- **0:00** - Professor clicks "Start Session"
- **0:00** - Session status = 'active', `updated_at` = current time
- **0:00** - QR code generated (expires in 30 seconds)
- **0:30** - QR code rotates (new QR, expires in 30 seconds)
- **1:00** - QR code rotates again
- **...continues every 30 seconds...**
- **60:00** - Session automatically completes after 1 hour

### Timer Calculation:
```javascript
const activationTime = new Date(session.updated_at);
const sessionEndTime = new Date(activationTime.getTime() + (60 * 60 * 1000)); // 1 hour later
const remaining = Math.max(0, Math.floor((sessionEndTime.getTime() - now.getTime()) / 1000));
```

## Key Points

✅ **QR Code Security**: 30-second expiration prevents cheating  
✅ **Session Duration**: 1 hour from activation (independent of QR codes)  
✅ **Timer Accuracy**: Uses activation time to calculate remaining time  
✅ **No Immediate Expiration**: Sessions now last the full hour  
✅ **Security Maintained**: QR codes still rotate every 30 seconds  

## Testing Results

- ✅ Session activates successfully
- ✅ Timer shows 59 minutes 59 seconds remaining
- ✅ QR codes expire every 30 seconds (security)
- ✅ Session will complete after 1 hour
- ✅ No more immediate "expired" messages

The session timer is now working correctly while maintaining the security features of QR code rotation!
